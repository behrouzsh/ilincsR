Description: Statistical methods addressing two levels of data integration:
    integration of the same type readouts into meta-signatures and integration of
    various types of readouts and meta-signatures into regulatory network activity
    signatures. The libraries of the signatures, meta-signatures and regulatory
    network activity signatures constructed using LINCS datasets are leveraged in
    the analysis of disease-related genomics data.
